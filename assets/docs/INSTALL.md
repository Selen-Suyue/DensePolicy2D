# üõ†Ô∏è Installation

## üíª Environments

Please follow the instructions to install the conda environments and the dependencies of the codebase. We recommend using CUDA 11.x during installations to avoid compatibility issues (remember to replace `11.x` in the following commands with your own CUDA version like `11.4`).

1. Create a new conda environment and activate the environment.
    ```bash
    conda create -n dsp python=3.8
    conda activate dsp
    ```

2. Install necessary dependencies.
    ```bash
    conda install cudatoolkit=11.x
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
## ü¶æ Real Robot

**Hardwares**.
- Flexiv Rizon 4 Robotic Arm (or other robotic arms)
- Dahuan AG-95 Gripper (or other grippers)
- Intel RealSense RGB-D Camera (D415/D435/L515)

**Softwares**.
- Ubuntu 20.04 (tested) with previous environment installed.
- If you are using Flexiv Rizon robotic arm, install the [Flexiv RDK](https://rdk.flexiv.com/manual/getting_started.html) to allow the remote control of the arm. Specifically, download [FlexivRDK v0.9](https://github.com/flexivrobotics/flexiv_rdk/releases/tag/v0.9) and copy `lib_py/flexivrdk.cpython-38-[arch].so` to the `device/robot/` directory. Please specify `[arch]` according to your settings. For our platform, `[arch]` is `x86_64-linux-gnu`.
- If you are using Dahuan AG-95 gripper, install the following python packages for communications.
  ```
  pip install pyserial==3.5 modbus_tk==1.1.3 
  ```
- If you are using Intel RealSense RGB-D camera, install the python wrapper `pyrealsense2` of `librealsense` according to [the official installation instructions](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/tree/master/wrappers/python#installation).
